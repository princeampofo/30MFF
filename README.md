This is my film website.

# Project Name
This website is titled "Making a film".

# Project Description 

This website is about showing people how to create films . The overall design is based on limiting the amount of colours on the page and using only one font family. I used this idea in order to get a bit more of uniformity across the page so that the user doesnt get distracted by the colors or using many fonts. The website has a scroll  behaviour which works well on chrome since the scroll effect is not cross browser compatible.

# Process 

The website has four sections namely home , film , crew and feedback. The home section has a navigation bar with a darker background colour. This darker background is to give the white text at the middle of the page more contrast. The typewrting effect was specifically used in other to make the home page a bit more interactivity and also tell the user about what they are expected to learn from the page. The next section which is film has a page title , the actual film ,like/dislike buttons and a description of the film. I made the like/ dislike buttons interactive so that users can click on them to show whether they enjoyed the video or not.The next section which is cast has the cast of movie. Upon hovering over an image , information about the actor appears on the image. The last section which is feedback allows users to send feedback about their experience on the wbesite and the film. Currently , any information enter on this page(feeback page) is not stored.
