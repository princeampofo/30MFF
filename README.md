This is my film website.

# Project Name
This website is titled "Making a film".

# Project Description 

This website is about showing people how to create films . The overall design is based on limiting the amount of colours on the page and using only one font family. I used this idea in order to get a bit more of uniformity across the page so that the user doesnt get distracted by the colors or using many fonts. The website has a scroll  behaviour which works well on chrome since the scroll effect is not cross browser compatible.

# Process 

The website has four sections namely home , film , crew and feedback.
